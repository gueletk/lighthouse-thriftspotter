A lightweight website for posting cool thrift store finds that was built in five days on a team of 2 people. Includes ability to post, like, and comment on items. The items can then be sorted by category and displayed on a map.

I did this project with Kristen Cheverie for a midterm assignment at Lighthouse Labs over the course of a week. The website is hosted on heroku.
